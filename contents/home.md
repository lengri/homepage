I'm PhD student at the Department of Earth Sciences, University College London. My work uses particle showers originating from distant galaxies to trace processes happening on the surface of our Earth. I research the application of terrestrial cosmogenic nuclides (TCN) in quantifying erosion rates around the work. More specifically, I spend a lot of my time thinking about the assumptions that go into this work. I use a combination of numerical modelling, field work, and laboratory analyses to answer the big questions in my field!
