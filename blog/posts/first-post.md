# The assumptions behind TCN erosion rates

*January 10, 2025*

Cosmogenic nuclide–derived erosion rates rely on several assumptions that are
often treated implicitly.

## 1. Steady-state erosion

The production–decay equation

$$
N = \frac{P}{\lambda + \rho \epsilon / \Lambda}
$$

already encodes strong assumptions about temporal stability.

## 2. Shielding & inheritance

Field observations during my MSc fieldwork suggest…
